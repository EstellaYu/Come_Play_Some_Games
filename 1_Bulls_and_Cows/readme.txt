// Bulls and Cows
// ----------------------------------------------

1. The system will generate a 4 digit number
	1) 4 digits are all unique [0-9]
	2) "0" is not the first digit

2. You will have 10 tries to guess this number. Within the 4 digits you guess: 
	1) the digits contained in the generated number, but NOT in the correct order will be counted as a "Bull"
	2) the digits contained in the generated number, AND in the correct order will be counted as a "Cow"

3. You can refer to more detail rules from the Wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows
